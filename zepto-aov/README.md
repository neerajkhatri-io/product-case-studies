# Zepto AOV  
## Increasing Order Value Without Breaking User Trust

---

## Context

Average Order Value (AOV) is a critical lever for quick-commerce platforms, directly impacting unit economics and profitability.

This case study explores how AOV can be increased **without relying on aggressive nudges or dark patterns**, and instead through alignment with user intent and behaviour.

---

## The Problem

While users frequently place small, convenience-driven orders, increasing basket size presents challenges:

- Users are sensitive to forced add-ons
- Overly aggressive nudges reduce trust
- Discounts can inflate AOV temporarily but hurt margins
- Users optimise for immediacy, not discovery

The challenge was to identify **sustainable AOV levers** that respect user intent.

---

## Key Insight

AOV increases are most effective when they:
- Align with the user’s existing intent
- Reduce friction rather than add pressure
- Feel helpful, not manipulative

Users respond better to **contextual relevance** than to blanket incentives.

---

## Solution Direction (Conceptual)

Potential approaches explored included:
- Context-aware recommendations
- Need-based bundling
- Timing nudges closer to checkout
- Framing additions as convenience, not upsell

The emphasis was on **behavioural alignment**, not forced expansion.

---

## Learnings

- AOV growth must preserve user trust
- Context matters more than discounts
- Short-term gains can undermine long-term retention
- Growth levers should respect the core value proposition
