# Decision Fatigue Reduction in Meal Planning UX

Designing a low-stress meal planning experience by reducing cognitive and emotional load during everyday decisions.

---

## Context

Meal planning is often positioned as a productivity problem, but in reality it is an **emotional and cognitive load problem**.

This UX-focused case explores how design can reduce friction, overwhelm, and decision fatigue in everyday planning tasks.

---

## The Problem

Users struggle with meal planning due to:
- Too many choices
- Repetitive decision-making
- Guilt associated with unhealthy or inconsistent habits
- Cognitive overload rather than lack of tools

Most solutions optimise for features, not emotional ease.

---

## Key Insight

Meal planning should feel:
- Calm
- Reassuring
- Non-judgemental
- Flexible

Reducing stress is more valuable than increasing control.

---

## Design Direction

The experience was designed to:
- Minimise choices per interaction
- Reduce visual noise
- Support gradual commitment
- Emphasise progress over perfection

Low-fidelity and interactive prototypes were used to validate flow and intent rather than visual polish.

---

## Learnings

- UX success is often about what you remove
- Emotional friction is as real as functional friction
- Calm design can be a differentiator
- Not all products need to optimise for speed

*This case study was developed as part of UX exploration and prototyping practice, focusing on decision fatigue and behavioural design.*
