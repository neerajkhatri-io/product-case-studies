# Designing for Reliability and Expectation Management in High-Stakes Bookings

In time-critical bookings, user trust depends more on predictability than speed.  
This case analyses how expectation-setting, perceived guarantees, and reliability signals influence user confidence in scheduled ride experiences.

## Context

Uber Reserve allows users to pre-book rides in advance instead of relying on real-time availability.  
Despite being particularly useful for **time-sensitive airport travel**, adoption of Uber Reserve among urban professionals has remained lower than expected.

This case study explores **why users still hesitate to trust Reserve**, and how adoption can be improved by addressing both **user anxiety** and **driver incentives**.

## User & Assumptions

**Primary User**
- Urban professional
- Frequent airport traveler

**City Context**
- Tier-1 city (Bengaluru)

**Key Assumptions**
- Airport travel is high-stakes and time-sensitive
- Users are willing to pay a premium for peace of mind
- Reliability matters more than price for this use case

---

## Job To Be Done (JTBD)

> **When I am travelling to and from the airport, help me pre-plan and reach on time without uncertainty.**

Supporting needs identified:
- Reliable pickup
- Pre-planned ride confirmation
- Luggage-friendly vehicle
- Pickup during odd hours
- Traffic-aware planning
- Peace of mind

---

## Problem Statement

Uber Reserve does **not fully remove the anxiety around pickup reliability** for airport commuters.

Despite booking in advance, users still worry about:
- Driver cancellations
- Late arrivals
- Last-minute uncertainty

As a result, many users continue to rely on regular Uber bookings, even for critical trips.

---

## Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

### Why is adoption low?
- Users do not trust that an Uber Reserve cab will arrive on time.

### Why don’t users trust Reserve?
- Reserve rides are often delayed or cancelled by drivers.

### Why do drivers cancel Reserve rides?
- Drivers feel the **financial incentive for blocking a time slot is insufficient**.
- A Reserve ride prevents drivers from accepting potentially higher-paying dynamic trips.

---

## Final Root Cause

> **Drivers have low financial incentive to honour Uber Reserve bookings**, leading to cancellations, delays, and ultimately lower user trust and adoption.

The problem is **not feature awareness**, but **incentive misalignment**.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Uber Reserve On-Time Pickup Guarantee (Airport Travel)

A reliability-first experience backed by clear incentives and accountability.

#### Key Elements

- Users can book rides **1–5 days in advance**
- Uber assigns a driver **75–90 minutes before pickup**
- If the driver does not move as expected:
  - A **backup driver is auto-assigned**
- If backup assignment fails within 30 minutes of pickup:
  - User is alerted
  - **₹500 credit** is issued as compensation

---

## Driver Incentive Redesign

To address the core root cause:

- Introduce a **higher base fare premium** for Uber Reserve (₹150–200)
- **100% of the premium goes directly to the driver**
- Drivers see **exact earnings before accepting** the ride
- Reliable drivers get **priority matching** for premium Reserve rides

This ensures drivers are financially rewarded for honouring time-blocked commitments.

---

## Why This Works

### For Users
- Reduced anxiety for critical trips
- Predictable, reliable airport pickups
- Clear accountability when things go wrong

### For Drivers
- Transparent earnings
- Better compensation for reserved time
- Incentives aligned with reliability, not cancellation

### For Uber
- Higher Reserve adoption
- Increased trust in pre-booking
- Better differentiation for airport travel use cases

---

## Key Learnings

- Adoption problems often stem from **system-level incentive misalignment**
- Reliability cannot be solved through UI alone
- Trust-based products require:
  - Clear guarantees
  - Economic alignment
  - Visible accountability
- Solving for both sides of the marketplace is essential

---

## Why This Case Matters

This case demonstrates:
- Strong JTBD framing
- Root cause analysis beyond surface symptoms
- Marketplace thinking (user + driver)
- Solutions grounded in behavioural and economic realities

It reflects how **trust and adoption improve when incentives are aligned across the system**, not just when features are added.
