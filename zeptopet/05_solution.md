# Proposed Solution

The solution focuses on increasing trust and decision confidence rather than expanding catalog size.

Key solution elements:
- Pet-specific contextualisation (e.g., pet type, age, size)
- Clear suitability indicators instead of generic descriptions
- Simplified guidance to reduce cognitive load
- Trust signals such as vet-backed tags or popularity among similar pet profiles

What the solution intentionally does NOT solve:
- It does not aim to educate users deeply about pet care
- It does not replace vet consultation
- It does not guarantee perfect product fit

The goal is to reduce hesitation enough to enable confident first and repeat purchases.
