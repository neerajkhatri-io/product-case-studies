# Key Learnings

- Adoption problems are often rooted in trust, not awareness
- Products involving emotional responsibility require different UX treatment
- Speed alone does not drive usage when perceived risk is high
- Reducing decision anxiety can be more impactful than adding features

If revisiting this problem, I would:
- Validate trust signals through user interviews
- Test lightweight guidance before building complex recommendation systems
- Focus early experiments on repeat usage rather than first-time conversion
