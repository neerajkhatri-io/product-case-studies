# ZeptoPet – Problem Statement

Urban pet owners increasingly rely on quick-commerce platforms for everyday needs. While essentials like groceries are reliably fulfilled, pet-related purchases face hesitation and low repeat usage.

The core problem is not lack of demand, but lack of trust and clarity around pet-specific products.

Users struggle with:
- Confidence in product suitability for their specific pet
- Fear of wrong purchases (food, treats, accessories)
- Limited ability to validate quality or relevance quickly

As a result, users either delay the purchase or shift to familiar offline or specialty pet stores despite higher effort.
