# Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

## Observed Symptom
Low adoption and low repeat usage of pet products on the platform.

### Why 1: Why are users not buying pet products frequently?
Because they do not fully trust the products offered.

### Why 2: Why is trust low?
Because users cannot easily verify if a product is suitable or safe for their specific pet.

### Why 3: Why can’t users verify suitability?
Because product information is generic, lacks context, and does not guide decision-making for different pet needs.

## Root Cause
The platform treats pet products like regular FMCG items, whereas users treat them as high-responsibility, trust-sensitive purchases.
