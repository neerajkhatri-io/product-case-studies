# Assumptions

The following assumptions were used for this case study:

- User is an urban pet owner (dog or cat)
- Lives in a metro or Tier-1 city
- Uses quick-commerce apps primarily for convenience
- Pet purchases are relatively infrequent but high-trust decisions
- User prefers speed but not at the cost of pet safety or quality
- User may not be deeply knowledgeable about pet products
- Purchase decisions are influenced by emotional responsibility towards the pet

These assumptions help narrow the problem space and guide solution exploration.
