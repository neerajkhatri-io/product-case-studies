# Increasing Order Value Through Behavioural Alignment

This project examines how order value can be increased by aligning pricing and product design with user behaviour rather than aggressive incentives.

Multiple solution paths were explored and prioritised using structured frameworks, focusing on long-term value creation over short-term optimisation.
## Context

Zepto operates in a high-frequency, convenience-driven quick commerce space.  
While usage is strong, **average order values (AOVs) remain constrained** because users primarily place small, need-based orders.

This case study explores **why users hesitate to add more items** and identifies **behaviourally aligned opportunities** to increase AOV without compromising trust, speed, or perceived value.

---

## Research Objective

To understand:
- How users currently shop on Zepto
- What motivates (or blocks) adding more items
- Which behavioural levers can increase AOV sustainably

The goal was **not to push more items**, but to **enable users to add items when value is genuinely clear**.

---

## Research Methodology

A mixed-methods approach was used to capture both scale and depth:

### Quantitative Survey
- 25 responses
- Covered shopping frequency, typical AOV ranges, motivations for adding items, barriers to basket expansion, price sensitivity, category trust, and suggestions for improvement

### One-on-One Interviews
- Short WhatsApp interviews to uncover micro-behaviours and emotional triggers
- One detailed recorded interview (Loom) to understand end-to-end decision flow, situational usage, and AOV thresholds

This combination enabled both **pattern recognition** and **behavioural nuance**.

---

## Key Behavioural Insights

### 1. Shopping Behaviour Is Fragmented
Users do not shop in one consistent way:
- **Urgent-need sprinters** place frequent, small orders
- **Weekly planners** add multiple items in planned sessions
- **Selective explorers** shop occasionally and are highly value-driven

This fragmentation directly impacts AOV potential.

---

### 2. Users Add Items Only When Value Is Clear
Across all segments:
- Users do **not** add items “just because”
- Additions happen when:
  - Savings are visible
  - Bundles feel relevant
  - Recommendations feel personal

Users actively avoid unnecessary items, even when discounts exist.

---

### 3. Key Barriers to Basket Expansion
Consistent blockers emerged:
- Price sensitivity vs local stores
- Unclear savings or discounts
- Delivery time increasing after adding items
- Trust issues in certain categories (electronics, fresh produce)
- Limited return or exchange confidence

These reduce willingness to explore beyond essentials.

---

## User Segmentation

Three behavioural segments were identified:

### Urgent-Need Sprinters
- Shop 4–7 times per month
- Small baskets
- Add items only if delivery thresholds or bundles are compelling

### Weekly Planners
- Structured, value-conscious shoppers
- Open to bundles and bulk adds
- Sensitive to quality and pricing transparency

### Selective Explorers
- Low-frequency users
- Deal-driven
- Avoid categories with trust or quality concerns

Segmentation ensured solutions were **behaviour-specific**, not generic.

---

## Problem Statement

> Zepto users primarily place small, need-based orders and struggle to discover relevant items.  
> Price sensitivity, unclear savings, weak discovery, and inconsistent experiences reduce willingness to build larger baskets — limiting AOV.

---

## Solution Ideation

Based on research insights, five solution directions were explored:

### Smart Add-Ons Based on First Item
Surface 3–5 hyper-relevant add-ons once the first item is added, based on context and past behaviour.

**Rationale:** Users add items only when relevance is obvious.

---

### Savings-Led Bundles
Create clearly priced, value-driven bundles (weekly packs, essentials combos) with visible savings.

**Rationale:** Bundles were one of the strongest motivators across user segments.

---

### Freshness & Quality Confidence Layer
Introduce quality signals such as freshness badges, better substitutes, and clearer guarantees.

**Rationale:** Trust issues limit basket expansion in produce and staples.

---

### Delivery Stability for Bigger Baskets
Prevent delivery time penalties when items are added, or communicate alternatives clearly.

**Rationale:** Users abandon additions when delivery time increases unexpectedly.

---

### Dynamic Cart-Based Nudges
Contextual prompts such as:
- “Add ₹40 more to save ₹60”
- “Add 2 items to unlock bundle savings”

**Rationale:** Threshold nudges consistently influenced user behaviour.

---

## Prioritisation (RICE Framework)

Each solution was evaluated using the **RICE framework**:
- Reach
- Impact
- Confidence
- Effort

This helped prioritise **high-impact, low-friction interventions** focused on sustainable AOV growth rather than short-term discounting.

---

## Key Learnings

- AOV growth is fundamentally a **behavioural design problem**
- Users resist forced expansion but respond to clarity and relevance
- Trust and delivery reliability are prerequisites for larger baskets
- Segmentation is essential — one AOV strategy does not fit all users

---

## Why This Case Matters

This case demonstrates:
- Rigorous user research
- Behaviour-first problem framing
- Structured prioritisation using RICE
- Solution thinking grounded in real-world constraints

It reflects how **AOV can be increased without eroding user trust**, by aligning incentives with genuine user value.
